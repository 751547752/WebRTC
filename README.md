# WebRTC Binaries for iOS
This repository contains unofficial distribution of WebRTC framework binaries for iOS.

Since version M80, Google has [deprecated](https://groups.google.com/g/discuss-webrtc/c/Ozvbd0p7Q1Y/m/M4WN2cRKCwAJ?pli=1) their mobile binary libraries distributions (Was officially using the [GoogleWebRTC pod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/GoogleWebRTC)). To get the most up to date WebRTC library, you can compile it on your own, or you can use precompiled binaries from other sources.

## Releases
The binary releases correspond with official Chromium releases and branches as specified in the [Chromium dashboard](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/branches).

## ðŸ’¡ Things to know
* All binaries in this repository are compiled from the official WebRTC [source code](https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/) without any modifications to the sources code or to the output binaries.
* Static framework (xcframework format) which contains binaries for both arm64 and x68_x64.
